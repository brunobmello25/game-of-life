# Game of Life

A simple zig implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Made it as a small project to learn zig.

## To do

- [ ] draw squares with holding mouse button instead of just clicking
- [ ] handle slow simulation with something other than setting target fps
- [ ] add finish state with a message to the user
